# Contributing to Contributing to iTwin ESLint Plugin

Welcome to the iTwin ESLint Plugin repository! We appreciate your interest in contributing to the project. Please take a moment to review this document before submitting any contributions.

## Reporting Issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem in iTwin ESLint Plugin?
Have a feature request?
We want to hear about it!
Here's how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.

### Look For an Existing Issue

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/iTwin/eslint-plugin/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

If you find that your issue already exists, please add relevant comments and your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments).
Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

- üëç - upvote
- üëé - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request.
Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input.
Many issues look similar, but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

Please include the following with each issue:

- A short description of the issue that becomes the title
- Versions of relevant iTwin.js packages
- Minimal steps to reproduce the issue or a code snippet that demonstrates the issue
- What you expected to see, versus what you actually saw
- Images that help explain the issue
- Any relevant error messages, logs, or other details
- Impact of the issue
- Use the [`bug`](https://github.com/iTwin/itwinjs-core/labels/bug) or [`enhancement`](https://github.com/iTwin/itwinjs-core/labels/enhancement) label to identify the type of issue you are filing

Don't feel bad if the developers can't reproduce the issue right away.
They will simply ask for more information!

### Follow Your Issue

You may be asked to clarify things or try different approaches, so please follow your issue and be responsive.

## Using Changesets

The primary implementation of [changesets](https://github.com/Noviny/changesets). Helps you manage the versioning
and changelog entries for your packages, with a focus on versioning within a mono-repository (though we support
single-package repositories too).

```
npx changeset
```
This command will ask you a series of questions, first about what packages you want to release, then what semver bump type for each package, then it will ask for a summary of the entire changeset. At the final step it will show the changeset it will generate, and confirm that you want to add it.

Once confirmed, the changeset will write a Markdown file that contains the summary and YAML front matter which stores the packages that will be released and the semver bump types for them.

A changeset that major bumps `@changesets/cli` would look like this:

```md
---
"@changesets/cli": major
---

A description of the major changes.
```
```
npx changeset version
```
Updates the versions for all packages described in changesets since last release along with any dependents inside the repo that are out of range.

Will also create/append to a CHANGELOG file for each package using the summaries from the changesets.

We recommend making sure changes made from this command are merged back into the base branch before you run `publish`.
